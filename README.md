# justdom.js: Yet another DOM manipulation library

justdom.js is a DOM manipulation library (like jQuery and friends). In contrast to most other DOM libraries it focuses not only on DOM modification but also on DOM generation and is suited both for client- and server-environments. However it does not try to abstract over non-conforming and legacy interfaces and assumes reasonably modern DOM and JavaScript implementations. It also does not try to provide non-DOM features like syntatic sugar for `XMLHttpRequest`.
